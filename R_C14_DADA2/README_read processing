For petB:
In fastq_petB folder, there are the fastq files for the petB amplified samples. 
Three types of samples:
1. CTD-NpetB-xx: CTD filtered samples, nested petB amplification
2. CTD-petB-xx: CTD filtered samples, normal petB amplification
3. syn-xx: sorted Synechococcus cells, nested petB amplification

There needs to be two different DADA2 processing, one for nested petB (CTD-NpetB-xx and syn-xx) and one for normal petB (CTD-petB-XX).

Databases:
- petB database is based on the Farrant et al. (2016) https://www.pnas.org/content/115/9/E2010.short
Uses ecologically taxonomic significant unit. "petB_721_FIXED_715_seqs_ShortName_FullLength.fasta" (from Laurence, email on 12 Jan 2021 (email in archives))
- To refer to the database:
    - databases/Farrant_database_ESTU.fasta
    - databases/Farrant_database_noESTU.fasta
    - databases/Farrant_database_unassigned.fasta (there are a few taxonomically unassigned sequences. If there are sequences unassigned in the sorted samples can run DADA2 with this and BLAST)

Use the source codes for the following processing: 
- param_dada2_datasetD1.R : for nested petB amplification of sorted syn cells
- param_dada2_datasetD2.R : for nested petB amplification of CTD filters
- param_dada2_datasetD3.R : for normal petB amplification of CTD filters

Also use the corresponding directories. 

Plug into the "DADA2_DO.Rmd" , need to edit certain sections at the end.

For 18SV4:
There are three types of samples:
1. pico-xx: sorted pico eukyarotes
2. nano-xx: sorted nano eukaryotes
3. CTD-18S-xx: CTD filtered samples

All use the same DADA2 processing.

Using pr2 database.

Use source code "param_dada2_datasetD4.R" for 18SV4 region. Also use corresponding directory.
