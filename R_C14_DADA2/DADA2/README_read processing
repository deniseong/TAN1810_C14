For DADA2 processing there are 2 Rmd files to choose:
- DADA2_paired.Rmd (for paired sequences)
- DADA2_unpaired.Rmd (for unpaired sequences)

For petB:

In fastq_petB folder, there are the fastq files for the petB amplified samples. 
Three types of samples:
1. CTD-NpetB-xx: CTD filtered samples, nested petB amplification
2. CTD-petB-xx: CTD filtered samples, normal petB amplification
3. syn-xx: sorted Synechococcus cells, nested petB amplification

There needs to be two different DADA2 processing, one for nested petB (CTD-NpetB-xx and syn-xx) and one for normal petB (CTD-petB-XX).

Databases:
- petB database is based on the Farrant et al. (2016) https://www.pnas.org/content/115/9/E2010.short
Uses ecologically taxonomic significant unit. "petB_721_FIXED_715_seqs_ShortName_FullLength.fasta" (from Laurence, email on 12 Jan 2021 (email in archives))
- To refer to the database:
    - databases/Farrant_database_ESTU.fasta
    - databases/Farrant_database_noESTU.fasta
    - databases/Farrant_database_unassigned.fasta (there are a few taxonomically unassigned sequences. If there are sequences unassigned in the sorted samples can run DADA2 with this and BLAST)
- For now we are using without the ESTU

For unpaired reads from the 2X250 petB run to get preliminary data. To input the parameters and the directories, change the following:
Parameters:
 -" param_dada2_datasetD1.1"

For the directories:
- "directories_DADA2_datasetD1.1.R" -- for C14 sorted syn cells R1
- "directories_DADA2_datasetD1.2.R" -- for CTD petB nested R1
- "directories_DADA2_datasetD1.3.R" -- for CTD petB normal R1
- "directories_DADA2_datasetD1.4.R" -- for C14 sorted syn cells R2
- "directories_DADA2_datasetD1.5.R" -- for CTD petB nested R2
- "directories_DADA2_datasetD1.6.R" -- for CTD petB normal R2

For 18SV4:
There are three types of samples:
1. pico-xx: sorted pico eukyarotes
2. nano-xx: sorted nano eukaryotes
3. CTD-18S-xx: CTD filtered samples

All use the same DADA2 processing.

Using pr2 database.

Use source code "param_dada2_datasetD4.R" for 18SV4 region. Also use corresponding directory.
