# Introduction

Q: How much does small phytoplankton contribute to carbon fixation?
A: 

Q: Why do we need direct measurements of carbon fixation rate?
A

Q:How does the diverse taxonomic groups of phytoplankton contribute to carbon fixation?
A:

This study aims to: 

1. Measure group-specific primary productivity
2. Community composition
in the south-west Pacific Ocean of 3 groups of small phytoplankton:
- picocyanobacteria Synechococcus
- picoeukaryotes (cell diameter from 0.2 to 3-μm) and 
- nanoeukaryotes (cell diameter from 3 to 20-μm)

Small phytoplankton are significant contributors to plankton biomass and primary productivity, but their cell-specific rates of carbon fixation vary greatly among and within groups depending on the season and location. Yet, only 6 studies have directly measured the group-specific rates of carbon fixation of different small phytoplankton groups. Hence more measurements across diverse environmental gradients are needed to characterize group-specific variability and to improve current productivity estimates. We investigated the carbon fixation rates and community composition of three phytoplankton groups: the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes (cell diameter from 0.2 to 3-μm) and nanoeukaryotes (cell diameter from 3 to 20-μm). 

This is the `posterdown_betterland` template for the {posterdown} package! I was inspired by the twitter thread of [Mike Morrison](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041) and wanted to apply the `#betterposter` concept to the reproducible (yet simple to use) functionality of the {posterdown} package [@R-posterdown]. If you're not an R user don't sweat as you do **NOT** need to use it at all! Feel free to use only the Markdown functionality of this package :)

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

To reference a citation you can add your `.bib` file to the working directory and name it in the YAML metadata or generate an automated one as done here, then you only need to reference the label value in the `.bib` file. For example this package is built on top of the wonderful {pagedown} package and I will cite it at the end of this sentance using this in the rmd `[@R-pagedown]` [@R-pagedown].

To get a better understanding of how to include features like these please refer to the {posterdown} [wiki](https://github.com/posterdown/wiki).

**_Now on to the results!_**

# DIscussion

Figure comparing rates
Significance of different groups
- scatterplot -  colours are the sampling location - red and blue. for each replicate?

Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`, Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure).

```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"}
par(mar=c(2,2,0,1))
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width,
     col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width")
```

Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the `echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure \@ref(fig:myprettycode)!

```{r myprettycode, echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=3.5, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#008080", 
        border = "#0b4545",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:8,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
